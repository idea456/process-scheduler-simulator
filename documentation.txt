TASK 1

For task 1, I implemented the First-Come-First-Served scheduling policy with the following assumptions:
- All processes names must be unique
- If arguments are provided, a text file must be provided and cannot be any other type
- In the process text file, there should be no whitespace and new lines between the processes and at the end of the document

To run task 1, in the command prompt, type in "./task-1-30067863" if no arguments are provided (excluding "")
If arguments are provided, type in "./task-1-30067863 (filename).txt" where filename is the name of the file (excluding "" and circular braces ())


TASK 2

For task 2, I implemented the Round Robin scheduling policy with the following assumptions:
- All processes names must be unique
- If arguments are provided, a text file must be provided and cannot be any other type
- In the process text file, there should be no whitespace and new lines between the processes and at the end of the document
- Newly added processes will be prioritised first over ready processes

To run task 2, in the command prompt, type in "./task-2-30067863" if no arguments are provided (excluding "")
If arguments are provided, type in "./task-2-30067863 (filename).txt" where filename is the name of the file (excluding "" and circular braces ())
